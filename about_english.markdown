I am a computer science student at the Silesian University of Technology. I have always been interested in computer games, but I started programming them relatively recently - during bachelor's degree at the Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology. After graduating, I decided to pursue that interest throughout master's degree, which is why I changed the university and chose the specialization **Interactive Three-Dimensional Graphics** in Gliwice. Currently, I am working on my master's thesis, the planned date of my defense is the beginning of July.  

Programming, watching and playing computer games takes up most of my free time, but sometimes I also like going to the climbing wall, reading a book or a comic or even folding origami.  

I would like to start developing my skills outside the university and gain industry experience. I am focused on learning and expanding my competences.
