| I am a computer science student at the Silesian University of Technology. I have always been interested in computer games, but I started programming them relatively recently - during engineering studies. After graduating, I decided to develop in this direction, which is why I changed the university and chose the specialization Interactive Interactive 3D Graphics in Gliwice, in Wroclaw it was not possible. I would like to start developing my skills outside the university and become familiar with apprenticeships. I am focused on learning and expanding my competences. Currently, I am writing a master's thesis, the planned date of defense is the beginning of July. |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacekbla/jacekbla.github.io/master/assets/img/pages/about/ja.jpg)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|
