I am a fresh computer science graduate at the Silesian University of Technology. On the 2nd of July 2020 I defended my master's thesis and now I am looking for opportunities to develop my skills outside the university. I am focused on learning and expanding my competences.

I have always been interested in computer games, but I started programming them relatively recently - during bachelor's degree at the Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology. After graduating, I decided to pursue that interest throughout master's degree, which is why I changed the university and chose the specialization **Interactive Three-Dimensional Graphics** in Gliwice.

Programming, playing and watching computer games takes up most of my free time. Recently, I've been focused on working with OpenGL graphics API and Unity game engine. I am currently looking for a programming internship or a junior position at a company that focuses on developing computer games or graphic software.
