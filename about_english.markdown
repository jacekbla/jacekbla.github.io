I am a computer science student at the Silesian University of Technology. I have always been interested in computer games, but I started programming them relatively recently - during engineering studies at the Wrocław University of Technology. After graduating, I decided to develop in this direction, which is why I changed my university and chose the specialization **Interactive Three-Dimensional Graphics** in Gliwice, in Wrocław it was not possible.

Programming, watching and playing computer games takes up most of my free time, but sometimes I also like climbing the climbing wall, reading a book or comic book or folding origami.

I would like to start developing my skills outside the university and become familiar with apprenticeships. I am focused on learning and expanding my competences. Currently, I am writing a master's thesis, the planned date of defense is the beginning of July.
