I am a computer science student at the Silesian University of Technology. I have always been interested in computer games, but I started programming them relatively recently - during engineering studies at the Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology. 
After graduating, I decided to develop in this field at master's degree, which is why I changed my university and chose the specialization **Interactive Three-Dimensional Graphics** in Gliwice.  

Programming, watching and playing computer games takes up most of my free time, but sometimes I also like going to the climbing wall, reading a book or a comic or even folding origami.  

I would like to start developing my skills outside the university and gain industry experience. I am focused on learning and expanding my competences. Currently, I am writing a master's thesis, the planned date of defense is the beginning of July.
