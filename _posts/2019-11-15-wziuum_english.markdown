The project was implemented in a group of four. Our task was to come up with and present the initial idea for the game and its implementation. Due to time constraints, we decided on a simple game which goal is to move the glowing square from one point to another using precise shots, bounces and special skills. The game was made using the **Unity** engine.

The idea of ​​the game is very simple, but we tried to diversify the game by adding different types of walls and the ability to bounce on the fly. Some passages remain closed until the appropriate items on the scene are collected.
The game consists of 6 levels, they differ in the color palette and game mechanics. At the beginning, the stages are static, the player is introduced to the basic types of walls: ordinary, from which the square bounces, sticky - at which the player stops and can shoot the square again, and destructive walls that should be avoided - contact with them means return to the beginning of the level. Later, however, moving elements and additional mechanics are gradually added.

Two people from our group were involved in creating graphics, game resources and level design. The other two were responsible for the scripts and implementations of the game mechanics. I was a part of the second team.

During the development of the application, we came to the conclusion that it would also be a good idea to build it for mobile devices. Unfortunately, there was not enough time in the basic time for application development. Despite this, after the deadline I managed to modify the controls and build the application for **Android** devices.
