One of my first games made with the Unity engine. A simple **2D platformer** in which I tested various tools available in the program. During the development of the application, I learned about the basics of animation, creating a user interface and sound support in the **Unity** engine.

The hero of the game can jump, bark and shoot a sausage that effectively deals with evil cats that prevent him from advancing game segments. On each level there are additional objects that the player can collect for points. The stage ends when you reach the golden sausage.

The game has been modified to support **Android** mobile devices. This version has added control buttons that enable navigation via the touch screen.
